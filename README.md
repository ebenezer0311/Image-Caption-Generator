# Image-Caption-Generator

- An image caption generator is a system or algorithm that automatically generates descriptive captions or textual explanations for images. It utilizes computer vision techniques to analyze the content and context of an image and then generates a relevant and coherent caption that describes the visual content

- Image Analysis: The image is fed into a pre-trained CNN, which extracts features and learns representations from the visual content. This step involves recognizing objects, detecting shapes, identifying colors, and understanding the spatial relationships within the image.

- BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric used to evaluate the quality of machine-generated translations or text generation tasks, such as image captioning.
 
- BLEU1 : 0.544
- BLEU2 : 3.002
